# space-time-distortion-timer

A companion tool for Pokemon: Legends Arceus.

Space-time distortions appear in the following time windows:

- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 25 minutes
- 40 minutes

The in-game space-time distortion timer will pause whenever a menu is opened or a battle is ongoing. Intense weather
conditions can prevent a space-time distortion from forming.

This timer indicates how much time is remaining within the current time window. This timer has a "Pause/Resume" button
for when you are spending time in a menu or in a battle. After a time window has exceeded a sound effect will play to
alert you that a space-time distortion may have possibly appeared. After 40 minutes a space-time distortion is
guaranteed so the timer will stop and reset.
